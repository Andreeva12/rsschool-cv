**What about me?**
I always want to learn new things. I stopped being afraid to learn programming because I thought I couldn't do it. But I try to study everything in this area every day. I studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics and studied a little of individual topics. 
****
I have no experience, but I'm ready to start from scratch. I'm sure I'm gaining experience with every assignment in your courses.

I was scared of registering on Codewars. But she managed to solve the problem. The task was this: We need to understand why this code is incorrect.
<p>The same code:
  
  `function``multiply(a, b){`

`a * b`

`}`
<p>My decision:
 
`function` `multiply (a, b) {`

  `return a * b`  
  
`}`
